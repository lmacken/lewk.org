So for Christmas I made a little investment and picked up a <a href="http://www.tabletopstudio.com/">Table Top Studio</a> for my girlfriend Lindsey, so she can photograph her jewelry and get an online shop up and running.  She's added a few pieces to her <a href="LinJi.etsy.com">store</a> so far, and I am going to shamelessly plug them, because they kick ass.

Feel free to contact her about commission work or special orders as well (she is able to fabricate similar pieces with a variety of different stones, etc).  She is going to be shooting more of her pieces in the near future, so those interested can stay up to date via her <a href="http://www.etsy.com/rss_shop.php?user_id=5047046">RSS feed</a>.

Note to dudes: chicks dig handmade jewelry (and valentines day is coming up).
