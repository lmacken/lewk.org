A couple of weeks ago I purchased a <a href="http://www.zoom.co.jp/english/products/h4/">Zoom H4 stereo recorder</a>, which is essentially a 4-track studio in the palm of your hands.  After playing around with it for a few weeks, I must say that it has exceeded my expectations in every way (except for some user interface quirks).  Having ~10 instruments and a steady stream of musicians in my apartment, it's amazing to finally be able to simply press a button and lay down tracks or record a jam session instantly.

I setup an account on <a href="http://ccmixter.org/media/people/lewk">ccMixter</a> and threw up a couple of tracks that I've recorded (one being the some <a href="http://lewk.org/blog/2006/03/19/bent">circuit bending</a> that I recorded a while back).  The other track, <a href="http://ccmixter.org/media/files/lewk/9110">arasmas.ogg</a>, I recorded the other day while playing around with some reverse delay and an acoustic guitar.  It's trippy as hell and turned out to be kinda cool.  I will be throwing the random shit that I record up on ccMixter in hopes of eventually being able to collaborate with other musicians around the world to produce some face-melting music.

<p>(also, drop me a line if you happen to be interested in picking up a Zoom H4; I'm able to get them cheaper than you can find anywhere online)</p>
