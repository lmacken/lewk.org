So my girlfriend and I set the <a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2006/08/the-law-of-attraction/">intention</a> to start 3 businesses this month.

<p>
I'm hoping to gear l00t towards {audio,video}philes, professionals, and people with good taste in electronics.  All items are going to be top-of-the-line, and will be *way* below list price.  If there is a certain piece of equipment that you are looking for, let me know and I'll see if I can get it or something that competes with it.  Comments and suggestions are welcome.

One down.. two to go.
