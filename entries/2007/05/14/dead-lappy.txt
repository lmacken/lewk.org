So my laptop finally shit the bed.  Whenever I move it even a little bit, the display flips out and hardlocks the whole machine.  Sometimes during POST it will give me the 'bad memory/mobo' beep code as well.

Running memtest86 yielded this disaster.

Has anyone seen anything like this before?  I've tried swapping out two different sticks of memory between the two different slots, with no luck -- so I'm thinking that the mobo is toasted.. but then why/how does the physical motion cause it to flip out?  Suggestions/donations welcome :)

Needless to say, I've been doing most of my hacking recently from my 100mhz Indy that was formerly my living room nethack console.
