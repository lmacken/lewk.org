My roomate recently received an <a href="http://www.alesis.com/product.php?id=13">Alesis Micron</a> synth as a wedding present, and then proceeded to leave it with me for a week while he went on his honeymoon.  Much noise ensued.

Here are a couple of tracks I recorded while messing around with it.  Due to the lack of time to actually sit down and produce a cohesive song, I'm throwing them up as-is.  I'm also releasing them under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a> so anyone can chop them up if they want.

This track hits hard the whole way through, but seriously starts dropping shit like a pigeon about 5 minutes in.  It's comprised of two tracks: the beat, and miscellaneous insanity that I was able to find while exploring the capabilities of the micron.

A journey through insomnia.  I really don't remember recording this at all, as I had been awake for about 50 hours.  The end product is pretty nuts.  I cannot be held responsible.  It's a single track; just one long jam.

(As for the naming scheme, I have been reading way too much <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Socratic_philosophy">pre-socratic philosophy</a> lately)
