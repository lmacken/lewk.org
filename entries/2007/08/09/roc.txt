With my college career at <a href="http://rit.edu">RIT</a> coming to an end, I had to say goodbye to Rochester NY last week.  My last day in Rochester consisted of <a href="http://openfacesandwicheatery.com/">open face</a> for lunch, and a tasty <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/57205944@N00/194520695/">Mark's Sloppy Plate</a> for dinner -- with an abundance of ruckus in between.

So last week I moved into a sweet apartment in Watertown, MA.  The place is right on Arlington street, and is in a pretty amazing neighborhood.  I'm 1 block from a basketball court, 2 blocks from a 24/7 711 (my girlfriend and I have already made multiple 4am slurpee &amp; nacho runs), and a 10 minute bus ride to harvard square.

One of my favorite parts about Watertown is that it is really not chainy at all. Every corner has a ton of mom&amp;pop shops, and I haven't seen a single McDonalds yet.  But by far the best part about living here -- <b><a href="http://www.russos.com/">RUSSOS</a></b>!!1.

One of the kids who lived in my last apartment left me with a pretty badass server rack, which I gladly accepted.  I still need to order some more shelving and such, but it's great to finally have a central place for all of my puters.
