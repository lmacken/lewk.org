So for the past two years I have been drinking <a href="http://www.enjoyingtea.com/chsine.html">Chunshan Silver Needle</a> on a daily basis, and have yet to even grow remotely tired of it.   Even to this day it still is able to produce a powerfully uplifting productive energy that focuses the mind.  People frequently ask me if I ever sleep.. the answer is sometimes, and the reason is mostly due to these golden needles.

A description from <a href="http://enjoyingtea.com">EnjoyingTea.com</a>:
</p><blockquote><i>
"Chunshan Silver Needle is considered the best and the most valuable of all yellow teas. Yellow are unfermented and become yellow as a by product of the stir frying stage of the tea making process. When infused the liquor turn to a clear yellow orange color. They have a pure and fresh fragrance and leave your mouth feeling cleansed and refreshed. Unlike white teas, yellow teas have a definite taste, which is quite singular and monotonic."

By far my favorite tea.</div></p>
