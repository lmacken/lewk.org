<p>
I'm excited to announce that the <a
href="http://turbogears.org">TurboGears2</a> web application stack
is now available in Fedora 12, 11 and EPEL-5.
</p>
<p>
<h3>What is TurboGears2?</h3>
<blockquote>
TurboGears 2 is the built on top of the experience of several next
generation web frameworks including TurboGears 1 (of course), Django,
and Rails. All of these frameworks had limitations which were
frustrating in various ways, and TG2 is an answer to that
frustration. We wanted something that had:
<br/>
  <ul>
  <li>Real multi-database support</li>
  <li>Horizontal data partitioning (sharding)</li>
  <li>Support for a variety of JavaScript toolkits, and new widget system to make building ajax heavy apps easier</li>
  <li>Support for multiple data-exchange formats.</li>
  <li>Built in extensibility via standard WSGI components</li>
  </ul>
