I'm pleased to announce that bodhi 0.2.0 has been <a href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-announce/2007-September/msg00008.html">released</a> and <a href="http://bodhi.fedoraproject.org">deployed</a>.
This release has fixed a ton of issues and introduces many new features,
such as:
</p>
<ul>

<li>Multi-build updates.  You can add as many builds to a single update as you
   want.  Bodhi will treat it as a single update, but will still send
   individual update notification mails for each build.</li>
<li>New homepage widget that allows you to keep up with the happenings inside of
   bodhi.  You can see the latest comments, testing/security/stable updates, and
   keep track of your own business.</li>
<li>Enhanced notifications.  If you commented on an update, you'll receive
   notifications when others comment on that update, and when that update is
   modified or changes states.</li>
<li>Automatic closing of bugs is now optional.</li>
<li>Build-completion improvements.  Package names will be automagically
   completed, and if you type '-' after, it will complete versions as
   well.</li>
<li>Positive/negative comments effect an updates 'karma'.  After an update
   achieves a karma of 3, it will automatically be pushed to the stable updates
   repository.  This will hopefully encourage testers to get involved with the
   updates-testing process a bit more, and will add some automation to the
   workflow</li>
<li>Extended metadata (updateinfo.xml.gz) should start appearing in the repodata,
   which will allow tools like pup and the yum-security plugin to take advantage
   of it and do some nifty stuff.</li>
<li>Reminders.  You'll get nagged when your update sits around in testing for too
   long, and so on..</li>
   </ul>
<p>
This release introduces many database changes from the previous version, so it
will be much easier to jump back into the release-early-release often cycle.
</p>
Soon to come: 
<ul>
<li>bodhi command-line client is almost ready to go.  It needs to be polished up
   a bit, but should be released soon.</li>
<li>RSS feeds and public details.</li>
<li>Better build-completion based on koji tags.</li>
<li>More sanity checking (koji buildroot verification, dependency closure,
        etc)</li>
<li>Better handling of obsolete updates</li>
</ul>
<p>
I would also like to thank Till Maas and Tim Lauridsen for taking the time to help out and do some great work.

<p>
There is still much to be done with bodhi, so if you're interested in
helping out, you can setup a local bodhi development playground with just a few
<a href="https://hosted.fedoraproject.org/projects/bodhi/wiki/Development">commands</a> and dive in.
