It's been a long time coming, but the <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL">Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL)</a> project is finally utilizing the <a href="http://koji.fedorahosted.org">Koji</a> build system and the <a href="http://bodhi.fedorahosted.org">Bodhi</a> updates system.
</p>
<p>
So I spent the past week hacking on EPEL support in <a href="http://bodhi.fedorahosted.org">bodhi</a>.  This was not a trivial task, and took <a href="https://fedorahosted.org/bodhi/timeline">more work than expected</a>.  Overall, it was a very beneficial experience, as I was able to hack in some higher level abstractions and also remove a lot of Fedora-specific assumptions in the code.  Most of the changes were what I would normally call "hacks", mainly because I wanted to do it without changing the database schema.  However, this gives me a much clearer picture as to what we need from the Bodhi v2.0 model.  Anyway, 28 bodhi upgrades later, and everything seems to be working fine.
</p>
<p>
The inevitable TurboGears2 rewrite/port of Bodhi is a little further down the
road.  I've already ported the original model from SQLObject to SQLAlchemy, but
the templates, controllers, and widgets still need to be ported.  If you're
interested in helping make bodhi suck less, then please come talk to me :)
</p>
<p>
Anyway, developers can now submit their EPEL updates <a href="http://bodhi.fedoraproject.org">here</a>, or by running `make update` in their EL CVS branches.  Admins can read the <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Bodhi_Infrastructure_SOP">Bodhi SOP</a> to learn how to push updates.
</p>
<p>
The workflow is far from perfect, but there has been some recent discussions as
to how we want EPEL to be treated differently compared to Fedora updates.  If
you have suggestions or comments, discussions should take place on <a
href="http://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/epel-devel-list">epel-devel-list</a>.
