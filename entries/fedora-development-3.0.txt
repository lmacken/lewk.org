Fedora Activity Day: Fedora Development Cycle 2009
#tags Fedora

Earlier this week I ventured to Raleigh for a <a
href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_Activity_Day_Fedora_Development_Cycle_2009">Fedora
Activity Day</a>, where a dozen or so people brainstormed for a
few days about ways to improve our development process.
I feel that it was a very productive experience, as it allowed
everyone to list the things that could use improvements, without
getting caught up in the technical or political details.
We hashed out a huge list of items in <a
href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Communicate/GobbyHowTo">Gobby</a>
, prioritized them, and discussed possible solutions for as many
as we could.

A good number of proposals came out of it:
