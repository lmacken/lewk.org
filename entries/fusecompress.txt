Transparent compression with FuseCompress

I proudly remain among a decreasing percentage of people who prefer
to deal with all of their email themselves, as opposed to letting google store
and datamine it.  I've been using my current email stack for about 6 years;
since I was a freshman in college.  I pop all email from a variety of servers
with fetchmail, process it with procmail, filter spam with
spamassassin/pyzor/razor, and slay mail with mutt (with the sidebar patch, of
course).  There are a few modifications that I'd eventually like to make to
this stack (fetchmail->getmail, esmtp->mutt, and if I'm really crazy,
mutt->nmh), and aside from the fact that you
pretty much need a CS degree to understand most of the filters
-- overall, it has been a pleasure to work with.

After every Fedora release, I try to give evolution/tbird another
shot, but I'm usually back to using mutt within hours ;) (I may give
tbird another shot at some point, considering I was just introduced
to <a href="http://muttator.mozdev.org">muttator</a>).

Anyway... Since I now use a ThinkPad <a href="/blog/thinkpad-benchmarks">x300</a> as a primary
workstation, I'm limited to only 64G of disk space.  After doing a fresh
install over the weekend, I figured I might as well setup a virtual
FuseCompress filesystem that I can use to store all of my mail and code in.
<a href="http://miio.net/fusecompress">FuseCompress</a> supports a variety of compression libraries, but out of the box
uses <a href="http://www.oberhumer.com/opensource/lzo/">lzo</a>, which is
optimized for real-time data compression.  As it turns out, getting everything
setup is extremely easy.

<b>Compressing your existing data</b>.<br/>
Here I move my email to ~/.Mail, and compress it.
<br/>
<blockquote><code><pre>
  # yum -y install fusecompress
  $ mv ~/{,.}Mail
  $ fusecompress_offline ~/.Mail
</pre></code></blockquote>
</p>
<p>
<b>Mounting the compressed filesystem</b>.<br/>
Now, all you need to do is throw the mountpoint in your /etc/fstab, and you're good
to go.
<br/>

<blockquote><code><pre>
  fusecompress#/home/lmacken/.Mail    /home/lmacken/Mail  fuse allow_other   0 0
</pre></code></blockquote>
</p>
<p>
I've been using this setup for a few days now, and haven't noticed
any issues whatsoever.  The lzo compression is pretty decent, for a
library that prefers speed over size.
<br/>
<blockquote><code><pre>
[lmacken@x300 Mail]$ du -sh
1.6G	.
1.6G	total
[lmacken@x300 Mail]$ du -sh --apparent-size
3.4G	.
3.4G	total
</pre></code></blockquote>

For better compression, you can easily set it to use bzip2.
I'd be interested to hear about other people's email
tips/tricks/tweaks/hacks!
