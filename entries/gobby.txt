A dedicated <a href="http://gobby.0x539.de/trac/">Gobby</a> session is now
running on <b>gobby.fedoraproject.org</b> !<br/><br/>
<b>*UPDATE*</b>: To address some initial security concerns, I've locked down
this instance to Fedora contributors only.  The password can be found in
<b>~lmacken/gobby</b> on fedorapeople.org (via ssh)

Yes, this raises the bar a little bit, but more of a reason to <a
href="https://admin.fedoraproject.org/accounts/">get a Fedora account</a> ;)

What is Gobby, you ask?
<blockquote>
"Gobby is a free collaborative editor supporting multiple documents in one
session and a multi-user chat. It runs on Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, Linux
and other Unix-like platforms."

If you're running Fedora, simply install the 'gobby' package, and you're ready
to go.  Click "Join Session", and connect to "gobby.fedoraproject.org".  You'll then be able to collaborate in real-time with others on code, documents, notes, etc.

Since this is wide-open for anyone to use, I've also setup a cron job that
frequently commits the session to a git repository.  You can view the changes
to our gobby session via <a href="http://gobby.fedoraproject.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=sobby/.git;a=summary">gitweb</a>.  Regardless, you should still save anything that you expect to keep locally.
