Birthday / Halloween
#tags life,halloween
<p>
So, I turned 24 years old on Sunday.  I ended up randomly flying to Rochester, NY with my buddy Pat to spend the weekend rocking out.  With zero plans set ahead of time, during the 3 days of playing it by ear I ended up catching 3 concerts (Dieselboy, Revision, and Argus Eye), eating 3 <a href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/61/194520695_66130ce30e_m.jpg">Mark's Plates</a>, hitting up a ridiculous number of parties, catching up with a ton of friends, and started recruting a couple of brilliant <a href="http://csh.rit.edu">CSH</a> freshman.

There is absolutely no way I could ever top my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Flanagan">Bob Flanagan</a> halloween costume from 2003 (photos are not safe for internet consumption), but this years was quite amusing.  As a last minute idea, I ended up going as an <a href="http://aig.com">AIG</a> Employee.
