liveusb-creator 3.13 release!
#tags liveusb-creator,Fedora,code
<p>
A new version of the liveusb-creator has just hit the <a
href="https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/liveusb-creator-3.13.1-1.fc20">Fedora repos</a>! It's
been a long time since there has been any major changes to the tool, but I
managed to find a couple of days last week to implement some much-needed
functionality.

This version features a new destructive installation method, which uses
<code>dd</code> to directly copy the the entire ISO to to your device,
overwriting your existing data and partitions. This method tends to be
much more reliable, since we don't have to crack open the ISOs, mess with
partition flags, or configure and install the bootloader ourselves. This
also means that DVD, netinst, and boot images finally work with this new
method as well. You can still perform the traditional non-destructive
install that the liveusb-creator has always done, and it remains the
default.

Unfortunately there is not a Windows build for this release just yet, as I
hit some issues getting dd.exe to work properly in my virtual machine.
Hopefully I'll be able to figure it out at some point next week. If any
Windows folks are out there and want to help out, checkout the <a

Guide</a> for instructions on setting things up.

There are also a number of other features in this release, including polkit
support, a number of UI improvements, and more. Checkout <a
