I spent the majority of yesterday at a DOS prompt.  Thankfully, it wasn't
as painful as it sounds, as git, vim and Python make Windows development
quite tolerable.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I was finally able to track down and fix a couple of major bugs in the
liveusb-creator on Windows XP and 7, and I pushed out a new build
yesterday with the following changes:
</p>

<p>
<ul>
  <li>Rebuilt with Python 2.7 and the latest PyQt4/pywin32/py2exe/NSIS</li>
  <li>Update to syslinux 4.03 in our Windows package, which works with Fedora 14</li>
  <li>Determine if we are running with admin privs, and warn otherwise</li>
  <li>Fix how and where we put our error logs</li>
  <li>Update our list of Fedora & Sugar releases</li>
  <li>Download releases to Downloads or My Documents</li>
  <li>Various Windows path-related fixes</li>
  <li>Translation updates</li>
</ul>
</p>
