So last week, on my way to grab a sandwich before class, I ended up shaking hands with our former president, Bill Clinton.  Turns out he was invited by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Golisano">Tom Golisano</a> to check out our new <a href="http://www.rit.edu/~gccis/">GCCIS</a> building, and to give an invite-only presentation (which I was not fortunate enough to attend).
