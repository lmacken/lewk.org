Good Python Habits: vim + pyflakes

Here is a neat little hack for running <a
href="http://divmod.org/trac/wiki/DivmodPyflakes">pyflakes</a> on Python
files after you save them.  I like using pyflakes for quickly catching dumb
errors, but you could easily replace it with a more comprehensive tool like
<a href="http://pychecker.sourceforge.net">pychecker</a>, or <a href="http://www.logilab.org/857">pylint</a> for more strict <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP8</a> compliance.
</p>
<p>
All you have to do is throw this in your ~/.vimrc
</p>

<blockquote><code>
au BufWritePost *.py !pyflakes %
</code></blockquote>

This has saved me *tons* of time and frustration over the past few weeks, and
I have no idea I lived without it.
