For those who aren't aware, Boston kicks ass.  There is a ton of stuff to do every night of the week, and there are always amazing concerts.

Here are some shows that I will be attending in the near future.

<b>9/13/07 - <a href="http://elements-dnb.com">Calyx & TeeBee</a></b><br/>
This show is going to be absolutely <i>face melting</i>.  Calyx and TeeBee are the best Drum 'n Bass producers on the planet, and they just released an amazing album recently.  <i>So</i> looking forward to this.

Funkyassgrooves.  'nuff said.

<b>10/04/07 - <a href="http://www.vai.com">Steve Vai</a></b><br/>
No only is Vai one of the greatest guitar players in existence, but he also has the most hilarious mannerisms and facial expressions ever (see about 1:10 into <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7wRUxBM3io">this video</a> for an example).

<b>10/17/07 - <a href="http://www.rodgab.com/">Rodrigo Y Gabriela</a></b><br/>
An incredible acoustic duet.  If you haven't heard of them, look them up on the <a href="http://youtube.com">tubes</a>.

I grew up idolizing these guys.  My band in high school ended up playing a handful of shows with them, and eventually recorded an album in their basement.  It'll be good to see these guys in action again.
