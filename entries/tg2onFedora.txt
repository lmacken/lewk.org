TurboGears2 on Fedora

So, I was finally able to force myself to take a break from hacking
on a few different TG2 applications to actually sit down and package
everything up, submit it all for review, and make sure everything
Just Works on Fedora.

You can start playing with <a href="http://turbogears.org/2.0">TurboGears2</a> by throwing my <a
href="http://lmacken.fedorapeople.org/tg2.repo">tg2.repo</a> file in
/etc/yum.repos.d, and then by installing the <b>TurboGears2</b>
package.  It should work fine alongside of any existing TurboGears
1.x installs, however it will pull in SQLAlchemy 0.5, which may
or may not cause problems with older models.  Once installed, checkout the fantastic <a href="http://turbogears.org/2.0/docs">TurboGears2 documentation</a> for details on diving into the framework.

I already have two TurboGears2 applications currently in production, and have had nothing but amazing experiences with the new stack.  I still love working on my older TG1.0 apps (such as <a href="http://bodhi.fedorahosted.org">bodhi</a>), which will still be supported for a long time, but with the ridiculous amounts of power that WSGI/Pylons/Paste/SQLAlchemy/ToscaWidgets/Mako gives you, I'm extremely tempted to start porting :)

Aside from testing the packages, you can also help by <a
href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging/ReviewGuidelines">reviewing</a>
various parts of the stack so we can get them into Fedora as soon as possible.  The
TG2 dependency tree of pending reviews can be found <a
