So I recently purchased a shiny new Thinkpad X300 to replace my T43.  I must say that the X300 is an absolutely incredible machine, but I'll let the graphs speak for themselves :)

Below are the results of some benchmarks that I ran comparing the Thinkpad X300, Z61t and T43.  All machines were running Fedora 8 using the 2.6.24.3 kernel.  CPU benchmarks were done using <a href="http://hardinfo.berlios.de/">hardinfo</a>, and disk benchmarks done with <a href="http://www.coker.com.au/bonnie++/">bonnie++</a>.  Graphs created with <a href="http://code.google.com/p/flot/">flot</a>.
