So I've been known to steer pretty clear from <a href="http://tigerdirect.com">TigerDirect</a>, due to their blatant sketchyness, but last week I gave in and decided to pick up a <a href="http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1723262&Sku=THD-500A">500G Seagate</a> disk and an external USB enclosure.  Upon arrival, I had everything setup and running in under 2 minutes, and started rsync'ing my home directory.  After a ~20 hour rsync, 3 chips on the board were toasted, and the enclosure was fried.

The amount of dead/dying hardware in my office is depressing :(
