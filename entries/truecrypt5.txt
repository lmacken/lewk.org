I was listening to the <a href="http://twit.tv/sn133">Security Now!</a> podcast yesterday, where <a href="http://www.grc.com">Steve Gibson</a> talked about the latest release of <a href="http://www.truecrypt.org/">TrueCrypt</a>.  I've had great experiences with TrueCrypt in the past, and Steve seems to have nothing but good things to say about it as well.
</p>
<p>
The most fascinating thing that he mentioned was that in his benchmarks (which entailed restoring a very fragged XP image, then running a batch script which used ntimer to clock the windows defraggers and vopt), Windows ran <b>significantly *FASTER*</b> when fully-encrypted with TrueCrypt, <b>than without</b>.
</p>
<p>
So it seems that the TrueCrypt guys have created drivers that not only encrypt/decrypt your data seemlessly on the fly, but are actually quite faster than the default Windows drivers.  Amazing.

I haven't tried to reproduce this locally, as I try to avoid firing up my
Windows vm guest at all costs.  However, I'm interested to hear if anyone else
notices this dramatic performance boost that Steve talks about when
using TrueCrypt5 in Windows.
